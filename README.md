# Fantasy-Premier-League
Fantasy Premier League is a very popular online game where players take on a role of managers, and choose the real football players to put into their teams. As players score goals in real life, they also accumulate points. The goal of this program is to find the best possible starting lineup (with maximum number of points), given the limited funds to afford those players. So the program actually solves a knapsack problem.
